# audiogram_plots

Use R and the ggplot package to create mean (+/- SEM or SD) audiogram plots from data in CSV/Excel format. Pure tone threshold (PTT) audiograms with or without Uncomfortable Loudness Levels (UCL) for Left/Right ears combined or for groups with L/R ears split.

Variables for text-size, linewidth, etc. are specified to make it easy to keep appearance same for all plots.

Simulated example data included. Example plots below, png and svg files are exported in the script to folder /output.
